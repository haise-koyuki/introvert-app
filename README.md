Never lose touch, even when you don’t care to respond.

Why I Built This

I’m not the type to answer instantly — or sometimes at all. But I’ve seen how that hurts people I actually do care about: family, close friends. This app is my tool to keep those connections alive without pretending to be glued to my phone.

It’s for introverts like me who don’t want to fake enthusiasm but don’t want to lose the people who matter either.

What It Does

introvert-app sends reminders when you haven’t responded to someone in hours or days — customizable by relationship and app. No more awkward “Why didn’t you reply?” moments, just cold, calculated nudges so you stay on top of what matters.

Core Features
	•	Unified access to all major social apps
Instagram, Messages, Messenger, WhatsApp, Snapchat — the app links reminders to your real messaging platforms.
	•	Selective app permissions
Choose which apps to track. No Bumble or Tinder reminders unless you want them.
	•	Contact importance grading
Rank contacts into tiers:
	1.	Family & BFFs (top priority)
	2.	Friends & Relatives
	3.	People you don’t really care about
	•	Customizable reminder delays per importance
Set your own reminder intervals (e.g., 2 hours for tier 1, 3 days for tier 3).
	•	Smart reminder options
Mark “I responded” or “I’ll do it later :)” — this pushes the reminder delay shorter and shorter to keep you honest.

⸻

How It Works
	1.	Connect your social apps for automatic tracking of message response times.
	2.	Assign or confirm contact importance grades.
	3.	Set reminder intervals per grade to match your style.
	4.	Receive discreet notifications pushing you to reply without feeling overwhelmed.
	5.	Use “responded” or “later” to tweak your reminder pacing dynamically.

Why This Is Different

I don’t care about instant replies. I care about not burning bridges. This app gives me (and you) control, not guilt or pressure.
